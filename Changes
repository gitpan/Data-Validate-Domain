	- Added support for options to alter behavior of is_domain with these new
	  options is_domain will be able to work with private domains with custom TLD's.
		- Special Thanks to Len Reed <lreed@levanta.com> for not only suggesting
		  the need for this but supplying several patches to help steer this
		  solution in the right direction.  Also made several documentation 
                  improvements. 
		- Additional thanks to Richard Sonnen <sonnen@richardsonnen.com> for 
		  helping flush out the details of how to utilize options in the
