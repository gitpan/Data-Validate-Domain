Revision history for Perl extension Data::Validate::Domain.

0.02  Fri Oct  28 12:46:51 2005
	- added is_hostname method (which is valid for either somehost or somehost.domain.com)
	- modified is_domain to verify TLD of domain supplied (Uses Net::Domain::TLD)
	- Fixed bug that allowed domain.com... to return the same results as domain.com 
	- Will no longer consider domain.com. to be valid

		Thanks to Smylers <smylers@donhost.co.uk> for the detailed bug 
		report and suggested fixes.
